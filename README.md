# Rock-Paper-Scissors-CLI
This project will use the CLI to play Rock Paper Scissors versus a computer that randomly selects a hand to play.

## Technologies
* Python

## Installation
Simply download the main.py file and place it anywhere. 

## What does this do?
This program will create a Player class with multiple private variables. The Player class will contain functions that keep track of wins, losses, and ties; as well as how often the player threw out each hand. This program will also have a function that will interpret the player's input and take the appropriate action,  a function that will generate a random move that the opponent will throw out, and a function to show the aforementioned win-loss record and the frequency with which the player throws out different hands.

This program imports the random module, and uses dictionaries to transform player input and handle the inner game logic.
